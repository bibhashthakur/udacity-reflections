What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    .git folder is created. This contains metadata about the entire repository, 
    e.g., commit history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
      Intermediate between WD and repository. Helps to commit only the files 
      with relevant changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  If there are changes made to multiple files, we can add the files which 
  belong to the same logical change to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
  Adding functionality which is not ready to be merged into the main code base. 
  When the feature is ready to be released, the branches may be merged.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  Helps to understand branches and reachability.
  
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
  The changes made to both branches are combined to a single branch. We make 
  this exact same representation in the diagram. Two paths are merged and follow 
  one path thereafter.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
  Pro: If there are huge changes, and there are no conflicts, merge automatically
  saves a lot of time and effort.
  Con: Automatic merging cannot solve merge conflicts when the same part of the 
  file is modified twice.
