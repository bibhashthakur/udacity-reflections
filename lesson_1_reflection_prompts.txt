How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Allowed faster comparison so that the typo could be easily detected.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Reflecting on the changes that were made over time can help the programmer to prevent similar mistakes in the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    We can fool around with the code knowing that the previous working commit works fine. Each commit can be used to denote a logical change in the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Code can be spread across multiple files. The changes made to a function may be reflected in some other function in another file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log displays the entire history of changes. Git diff displays changes relative to a particular commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We could always go back to the last commit that worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making a cool project with teammates.
